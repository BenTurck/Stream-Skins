    The frontend of the software is using many write to file functions using the namespace System.IO. 
    There is a writetofile and reset script for each game to make sure there are no errors. 
    Every method is started with the name of the game or menu to easily place objects in the right spot in unity.
    It can get very cluttered if there are objects that are not labeled correctly.
