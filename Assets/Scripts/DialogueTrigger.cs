/*  The Trigger
 * The trigger is what's going to connect
 * to the button and we need to find a way
 * to access the sign in successful boolean 
 * variable and use that to decide if we 
 * send a sign up/sign in successful message or 
 * a sign up/sign in failure message. 
 * obviously based on that true or false boolean.
